# Fineace Platform - AIA Chain Inaugural Hackathon Project
## Overview
Fineace Platform is a powerful and intuitive budgeting platform developed during the AIA Chain Inaugural Hackathon. Our team designed this platform with the goal of helping organizations efficiently manage their budgets while leveraging smart contracts for secure backend processes and AI-powered features like an intelligent chatbot for enhanced user interaction. The platform enables users to submit budget requests, track them through various stages (pending, approved, rejected), and receive real-time updates. On the backend, we implemented smart contracts for robust and transparent budget management, ensuring security and immutability.
## Features
Budget Submission & Tracking: Users can create and track budgets in real time, from submission to approval or rejection.
## AI-Powered Chatbox
 Integrated with AI to assist users in navigating the platform, answering queries, and providing guidance.
## Smart Contract Integration
 Secure backend infrastructure leveraging blockchain technology to ensure budget data integrity and transparency.
Admin Dashboard: Admins can review, approve, or reject budget requests, which automatically reflect on usersâ€™ dashboards.
Responsive Design: Built with Vite for a fast, scalable, and modern frontend experience.
## Tech Stack
Frontend: Vite (React)
Backend: Smart Contracts (Ethereum Blockchain)
AI Integration: Custom AI chatbot powered by natural language processing (NLP) tools
Additional Tools:
Tailwind CSS for styling
Solidity for writing smart contracts
Ethers.js for interacting with Ethereum blockchain
